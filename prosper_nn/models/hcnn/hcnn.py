    The HCNN class creates a Historical Consistent Neural Network.

    A Historical Consistent Neural Network belongs to the class of Recurrent Neural Networks.
    A special feature of the architecture is that it has no input in the common sense.
    Instead, all the inputs are also interpreted as targets that are equally important.
    So the architecture does not distinguish between input and output features.
    Furthermore, it uses teacher forcing to correct the hidden state.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n_state_neurons : int
            The dimension of the state in the HCNN Cell. It must be a positive integer
            with n_state_neurons >= n_features_Y.
        n_features_Y : int
            The size of the data in each timestamp. It must be a positive integer.
        past_horizon : int
            The past horizon gives the amount of time steps into the past,
            where an observation is available.
            It represents the number of comparisons between expectation and observation and
            therefore the amount of teacher forcing.
        forecast_horizon : int
            The forecast horizon gives the amount of time steps into the future,
            where no observation is available.
            It represents the amount of forecast steps the model returns.
        sparsity : float
            The share of weights that are set to zero in the matrix A.
            These weights are not trainable and therefore always zero.
            For big matrices (dimension > 50) this can be necessary to guarantee
            numerical stability and it increases the long-term memory of the model.
        activation : Type[torch.autograd.Function]
            The activation function that is applied on the output of the hidden layers.
            The same function is used on all hidden layers.
            No function is applied if no function is given.
        lstm: boolean
           Include long short-term memory or not.
        init_state : torch.Tensor
            The initial state of the HCNN model.
            Can be given optionally and is chosen randomly if not specified.
        learn_init_state: boolean
            Learn the initial hidden state or not.
        teacher_forcing: float
            The probability that teacher forcing is applied for a single state neuron.
            In each time step this is repeated and therefore enforces stochastic learning
            if the value is smaller than 1. Since not all nodes are corrected then, it is
            partial teacher forcing (ptf).
        decrease_teacher_forcing: float
            The amount by which teacher_forcing is decreased each epoch.

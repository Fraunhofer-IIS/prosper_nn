        Parameters
        ----------
        n_state_neurons : int
            The dimension of the state in the HCNN Cell. It must be an positive integer
            with n_state_neuron >= n_features_Y.
        n_features_Y : int
            The size of the data in each timestamp. It must be an positive integer.
        sparsity : float
            The share of weights that are set to zero in the matrix A.
            These weights are not trainable and therefore always zero.
            For big matrices (dimension > 50) this can be necessary to guarantee
            numerical stability and increases the long-term memory of the model.
        activation : Type[torch.autograd.Function]
            The activation function that is applied on the output of the hidden layers.
            The same function is used on all hidden layers.
            No function is applied if no function is given.
        teacher_forcing : float
            The probability that teacher forcing is applied for a single state neuron.
            In each time step this is repeated and therefore enforces stochastic learning
            if the value is smaller than 1. Since not all nodes are corrected then, it is
            partial teacher forcing (ptf).
        backward_full_Y: bool
            Apply partial teacher forcing dropout after or before the output is calculated.
            If True dropout layer is applied afterwards and the output contains the errors of all features.
            If False dropout is applied before and the output contains only the errors that are not dropped.
            The remaining entries are zero and therefore contain no error.
        ptf_in_backward: bool
            If True nothing happens and the Dropout layer is handled as it is in the backward path.
            If False the Dropout layer is skipped in the backward path.
